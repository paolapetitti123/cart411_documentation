                    Zdzisław Beksiński is known as the first person to create Surrealist Dystopian Art back in the early
                    1970s, a lot his work inspired the initial concept of my project as I
                    wanted to go with a dystopian themed game. The Artwork that I referenced above (#3) really
                    encapsulates the isolation and namelessness that I want players to experience as in
                    my game the player is just yet another citicizen whos under the control of the government and is
                    just another number to them. Now this goes into play with my second reference being
                    the article on how we unwillingly train Google's AI models through their captcha systems, so these
                    kinds of captcha systems is kind of what the game is going to replicate as a way
                    to critique AI art and on a larger scale, systems we use daily collecting data from us for their own
                    gain. To tie the entire game together, the game Assessment Examination free to play
                    on itch.io stylistically is what the captchas are going to resemble format wise and this game is
                    also what gave me the idea to create a 3D environment with the VCR tv and such, more so
                    for aesthetic reasons. I think the VCR idea will give the game a more unsettling experience, at
                    least that's what I am hoping for.
