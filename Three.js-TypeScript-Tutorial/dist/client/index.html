                    Welcome to my personal website where I will be documenting the process of my semester long personal project for the class CART411.

                    <br><br>
                    A little about this project, I've recently been into thrillers and horrors, ontop of being a pretty big fan of the band ATEEZ.
                    In 2022, ATEEZ released an album titled "The World EP.1: Movement" and they released a lot of really cool teasers and trailers for this album which heavily 
                    inspired this project. The premis of this project is simply you are in a room that only has an exit door you can't get out of and a table that has a VHS tv on it.
                    You have to push the VHS into the tv and that starts the game where you'll have to complete an assessment examination. The assessment test part is inspired by analog 
                    horror games I've played in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly this project was one I've been wanting to complete for quite some time as a way to teach myself how to use Three.JS, where as you can see by 
                    the little 3D model of myself to the right here, I already started figuring it out!
